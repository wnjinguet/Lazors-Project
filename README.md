This lazor project is our attempt to both read and solve the lazor game. The lazor game has several boards, the goal of this project is to create a code that is able to read several boards and win the game. 

To run the game, download all the board files (.bff) and Solver.py on your local directory.

All files need to be stored in the same folder (all .bff and .py files previously mentioned).

The Solver.py will generate .png files with the solution in the same folder that it is stored after solving each problem.

There is an "Ideas" document that shows how we decided to approach this project.

The python code is the "Solver.py" file. The other one is simply a draft code and can be ignored. (Note: The draft python file was reuploaded and the contributions of previous members seems to be lost, yet each member worked on a different parts of the code and ultimately the ideas for each part were combined into the Solver file)
